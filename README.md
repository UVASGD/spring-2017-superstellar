#Super Stellar

###Inspiration
We based this game off of games such as Agar.io and Diep.io, hoping to make
a simple multiplayer shooter game

###What it does
Players spawn on the screen and fight other stars by shooting their points. All players initially spawn as a "normal" star. As the player survives the game longer and defeats more stars, they
will level up into stars such as a "Red giant" and  "Super Nova."

###How we built it
We built this game using the Unity Game Engine, C#, and Photon Unity Network.

###Challenges we ran into
Networking was a little tricky!

###Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have a great team and we were able to create a functional game in a relatively quick time

###What we learned
We learned how to use Unity and how to use the Photon Unity Network to create a multiplayer game

###What's next for About Me Without Me
Add more types of stars and polish the mechanics of the game
